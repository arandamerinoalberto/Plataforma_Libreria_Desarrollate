# Plataforma_Libreria_Desarrollate

This is my first project done in PHP, where I made an internal management system for a library.

In it, we can carry out the different actions of registration, cancellation, consultation and modification of users, categories, books and orders.
All these files are linked to a database called libreria_2.sql.

This will be the first file that you will have to upload to the MariaDB database in phpmyadmin.

To run it you will have to initialize XAMMP and activate the two modules, both Apache and MYSQL.

If you have any questions about its activation or start-up you can write to me at: arandamerinoalberto@gmail.com

Regards!
